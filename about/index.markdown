I'm Chris Dillon.  I live in Portland but I'm from DC.  This is my productivity blog.  This is where I share things I've gotten done, figured out or want to do for myself and others.  This blog applies the [do it for yourself](http://gapingvoid.com/2004/08/29/nobody-cares-do-it-for-yourself/) rule in a major way.  If you find something useful here then this blog has succeeded.  This blog is also about practicing my craft.  Runners train, musicians practice.

This is a personal weblog. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.

By day, I do software development and devops.  It just means I'm a jack of all
trades.  By night, I'm a technologist looking to get better at stuff.
But not all the time.  Sometimes I just want to build stuff (either real or virtual).
I don't talk about gaming or playing music on this blog.  I found that to be not
interesting to people (or at least the way I did it).

Sometimes, I do creative coding, procedural sketch toys, sound prod or prototypes.
Other times, I actually build tools and toys so solve a problem I have.
I have a lot of other hobbies like a lot of other people but code is the
thing I mostly blog about.

I don't work with recruiters or placement agencies.  I'm probably not looking for "a job" but
that doesn't mean I won't help you.

* See [my page of boundaries](/questions) to see specifics on my experience border.
* See [my github page](http://github.com/squarism) to see some projects I have published.  This list is far shorter than my projects I'm "secretly" working on.  :)
