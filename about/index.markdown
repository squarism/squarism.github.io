<p>I'm Chris Dillon.  This is my productivity blog.  This is where I share things I've gotten done, figured out or want to do for myself and others.  This blog applies the <a href="http://gapingvoid.com/2004/08/29/nobody-cares-do-it-for-yourself/">do it for yourself</a> rule in a major way.  If you find something useful here then this blog has succeeded.  This blog is also about practicing my craft.  Runners train, musicians practice.</p>
<p>This is a personal weblog. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer.</p>
<p>By day, I do software development and systems integration.  It just means I'm a jack of all trades.  By night, I'm a technologist looking to work on bleeding edge or "trendy" tech.  In some sense, I do tech art (simple OpenGL on Mac, processing.org sketches and sound production and web prototyping.  I've been hacking quite a bit on Ruby and Rails creating small projects that serve as a proof of concept or learning device.  Other times, I actually build tools and toys so solve a problem I have.  I have a lot of other hobbies but code is the thing I mostly blog about.</p>
<p>I don't work with recruiters or placement agencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="/questions">my page of boundries</a> to see specifics on my experience border.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://github.com/squarism">my github page</a> to see some projects I have published.  This list is far shorter than my projects I'm "secretly" working on.  :)</li>
<p></ul></p>
