<h2>The Spike</h2>
<p><br />
I was spiking on Redis recently.  I wanted to use the <a href="https://github.com/nateware/redis-objects">redis-objects gem</a> to simulate a shopping cart app even though the README specifically says&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>Just use MySQL, k?</p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to see what would happen if I tried it anyway.  So the README and examples for the redis-objects gem are great so I'm not going to rehash what's there.  However, I will say though that the example has you hardcode the id field to 1.  That detail snuck up on me.</p>
<p>If you don't set an ID then you can't work with a redis-object instance.  You get an exception: <code>Redis::Objects::NilObjectId: Attempt to address redis-object :name on class User with nil id (unsaved record?)</code></p>
<p>It's basically trying to tell you, "hey, save the record first or set an ID".  Well, honestly, I don't want to set an id myself.  This is where the meat of the README is.  Redis-objects really fits organically in an existing ActiveRecord model.  That means Rails.  In this case though, I don't want an entire Rails app.  I can see the value though in a plain old Rails app.  Just look at the examples if you want to see more.</p>
<p>Anyway, continuing on with the spiking, I tried to integrate the Supermodel gem with Redis-objects.  That sort of worked.  You just <code>class User &lt; Supermodel::Base</code> and you can sort of get it to work.  This is great because Supermodel gives you finders like <code>User.find_by_email('bob@yahoo.com')</code> to make it act like ActiveRecord but you can't use <code>.create(email: 'bob@yahoo.com')</code> to begin with because of the same errors as I mentioned above.  Redis-objects really wants the record to have an ID already.  Even using Supermodel's RandomID mixin didn't work.  The initialize order and callback hooks don't really work (or at least I couldn't get them to work).</p>
<p>Finally, I tried combining just redis-objects and datamapper redis.  That worked.  And it's pretty nice.  Check it out.</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
require 'redis-objects'<br />
require 'dm-core'<br />
require 'dm-redis-adapter'
<p>DataMapper.setup(:default, {:adapter  =&gt; "redis"})</p>
<p># you would move this to a common location<br />
Redis.current = Redis.new(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1', :port =&gt; 6379)</p>
<p>class User<br />
  include Redis::Objects<br />
  include DataMapper::Resource</p>
<p>  # datamapper fields, just used for .create<br />
  property :id, Serial<br />
  property :email, String</p>
<p>  # use redis-objects fields for everything else<br />
  value :disabled<br />
  value :name<br />
  list :cart, :marshal =&gt; true</p>
<p>end</p>
<p># absolutely need this line for dm-redis<br />
User.finalize<br />
</p>
<p>So using this is pretty easy.</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
u = User.create(email: 'test@test.com')<br />
u.name = 'Testy McTesterson'<br />
</pre>
<p>When you look at Redis, the keys are already composited for you and magic has happened.</p>
<pre lang="reg">
redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; keys *<br />
user:test@test.com:name
<p>redis 127.0.0.1:6379&gt; get user:test@test.com:name<br />
Testy McTesterson<br />
</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>The name field is from redis-objects and the create uses datamapper.  This is a really odd pairing but I like the fact that I have no sql database in the mix but still have finders similar to an ORM.  Something to keep in mind, datamapper's finders are a bit different than the Rails 3 ones (no .where method).</p>
<h2>Benchmarking A Million Things</h2><br />
Ok fine.  So maybe this works, maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it's not the right idea.  What about the good stuff?  Like, how fast can we load a whole lot of names into MySQL versus Redis using  the above code and techniques?  Is it even relevant?
<pre lang="reg">
Summary<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
(PL = pipelined redis operation)
<p>Loading one million random names (full names) like John Smith, Patty Gerbee Sr)<br />
MySQL:                   06:05<br />
Redis:                   02:45<br />
Redis C ext              01:32<br />

Redis pipelined C ext:   00:19<br />
Ruby just loading array: 387ms</p>
<p>Loading 10k ecommerce-style data (orders, users, products)<br />

<br />

<h2>A More Complete Example</h2><br />
If you know the ID and don't need something like an auto-incrementing column outside your code/control then you can greatly simplify the code above by getting rid of Datamapper.  You can simply use redis-objects to fake an ORM.  I had great success using it as long as you <em>USE NATIVE REDIS TYPES</em>.  Listen to the redis-objects author, don't try to force the tool into the use case.
<pre lang="ruby">
# What if we want to use redis-objects as a database but<br />
# try to stick with native redis objects?<br />
#<br />
# For example, Supermodel is a great gem but using the Redis<br />
# mixin causes Supermodel to serialize to JSON strings in Redis<br />
# which is going to kill performance.  You have to model your<br />
# problem using native Redis objects to keep the speed up.<br />
#<br />
# At the same time, I miss the finders from ActiveModel<br />
# like: Person.find('Joe')<br />
# Supermodel does give you those finders so you will feel right at<br />
# home coming from Rails.  I tried using ActiveModel mixins with<br />
# redis-objects but it didn't work for me.<br />
#<br />
# I found the below a nice compromise but it requires a lot of<br />
# custom methods.  :(
<p>require 'redis-objects'</p>
<p>class Person<br />
  attr_reader :name<br />
  alias :id :name</p>
<p>  include Redis::Objects</p>
<p>  def initialize name<br />
    @name = name<br />
  end</p>
<p>  def self.exists? name<br />
    # Here's a big assumption, if the id attribute exists, the entire<br />
    # object exists.  This might not work for your problem.<br />
    self.redis.exists "name:{#name}:id"<br />
  end</p>
<p>  def self.find name<br />
    # new behaves like find when a record exists, so this works like<br />
    # find_or_create()<br />
    self.new name<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # native redis attributes with redis-objects<br />
  value :age<br />
  list :favorite_foods<br />
end</p>
<p># example usage</p>
<p>joe = Person.new 'Joe'<br />
joe.age = 34<br />
joe.favorite_foods &lt;&lt; ['cake', 'pie']  # it will flatten arrays, don't worry<br />
joe.favorite_foods &lt;&lt; 'bacon'          # or you can do this</p>
<p>Person.find('Joe').age = 56</p>
<p># find and initialize<br />
Person.find('Stan').age = 21</p>
<p># you cannot just .favorite_foods = ['Steak]' because that's not how native<br />
# Redis objects work<br />
Person.find('Stan').favorite_foods &lt;&lt; 'Steak'</p>
<p># deleting a field<br />
Person.find('Stan').favorite_foods.del  # notice it's .del and not .delete (del is the redis cmd)<br />
