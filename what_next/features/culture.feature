Feature: Culture
  In order to love day to day work
  As a human being
  I want to work in a place I love

  Scenario: People think more creatively with plants around (etc)
    Given that office design is pretty arbitrary
    And I've sometimes worked in concrete holes
    When I look at an office space
    Then I want to know that someone thought about employee happiness at least at little

  Scenario: CO2 is probably a problem
    Given that I don't have a garage with an electric plug
    When I go to work
    Then I'd like to ride my bike

  Scenario: I moved to Portland on purpose
    Given that people are nicer and different on the west coast
    And I sold my house and moved my family to Portland
    When I get my first local job here
    Then I don't want to over-expect but I want it to be crazy-awesome (it probably will be)

  Scenario: People work more creatively when they can laugh
    Given that work should be fun
    When I make bad jokes
    Then we can have a good time while getting stuff done
