Feature: Tactics
  In order to be practical
  As a software developer or devops person
  I want to mitigate human biases and problems with configuration, code and infrastructure

  Scenario: Code as infrastructure
    Given a meeting where people have different cloud bubbles over their heads
    And we need to collaborate
    When we communicate and implement business rules and team decisions
    Then we should communicate through code as infrastructure

  Scenario: Monday morning
    Given we've all reset since our last sprint
    When we come in
    Then I've love a stand-up to load our brains and get to work

  Scenario: Communication is hard
    Given I'm trying to learn how things work at Puppet Labs
    When I'm seeking help
    Then I've love IRC/Wikis/Bots and internal tools to help team dynamics (github strategy)

  Scenario: Testing gives confidence but not guarantees
    Given everyone is comfortable with testing
    When we decide to do TDD or not
    Then we all should know what the trade-offs and benefits are

  Scenario: Automation should be the norm
    Given we have too much to do and we are fallible creatures
    When we see repeatable steps
    Then we should know to automate it

  Scenario: Tools need sharpening
    Given we keep typing sl instead of ls in a shell
    When we run an analysis script of our history file
    And discover our top most typoed commands
    Then we should write down an solution to work on later
