Feature: Technical Growth
  In order to improve
  As an engineer and writer
  I want to learn new tools

  Scenario: DevOps have become a thing since I was a sysadmin back in the day
    Given there are a ton of tools out there
    And I know generic technologies
    And I don't really grok how Docker works
    And where Docker sits in the space
    When I have a job to do that might benefit from Docker
    Then I'd like to have time and equipment and encouragement (however slight) to learn Docker

  Scenario: Traditional organizations are painfully behind the curve
    Given I have seen failures in person
    When I see how it's actually done right
    Then I'll have a great appreciation for the solution

  Scenario: Rails apps are annoying to deploy
    Given the simplest rails application
    And I know how to do all the steps by hand
    When I want to not configure RVM and Passenger for the Nth time
    Then I'd love to know how Puppet integrates and compares with Docker/Chef/Capistrano/...

  Scenario: Ruby is slow
    Given that I love Ruby to death
    And it's given me the opportunity to touch on many problem domains quickly
    When I need parallelism
    Then I've love to have Go as a secondary language I can speak

  Scenario: Mutation and state kills
    Given that concurrency hates mutation
    When I modify objects in place
    And hard bugs pop up
    Then I wish I knew a functional language

  Scenario: Managing N number of boxes changes your approach
    Given that I can't ssh into 500 boxes
    When a large scale problem arises
    And I want to provision a million MongoDB nodes
    Then I wish I had tools in my belt that work at scale

  Scenario: I have a list of personal boundaries that work should chip away at
    Given that experience stops somewhere
    When I look at my personal boundary list at http://squarism.com/questions
    And it's assumed that this isn't the entire list
    Then I see that I'm checking things off
