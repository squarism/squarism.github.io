Feature: Great People
  In order to be a social being
  As a team member
  I want to align, inspire, fuel and contribute

  Scenario: All problems are people problems
    Given that we have biases and psychology whether we talk about it or not
    When I talk about books and talks like "Refactor your wetware" or "The Passionate Programmer"
    Then I'd love to have a two way conversation about meta and psych topics
    And just know that like-minded people work with me

  Scenario: We all have specializations and something to give
    Given that I have some area of expertise or figure something out that's relevant
    When I realize, "I should give a talk on this!"
    Then I can give a talk or write a blog post

  Scenario: I am not an island of all knowledge
    Given that someone wants to share
    When I have time
    Then I'd like to stay after work and listen to a talk or presentation and lift people up

  Scenario: Tricks spread with pairing
    Given that I feel like a big fish in a small pond
    When I pair with different people over some period of time
    Then I'd love to be learning workflows, shortcuts and tricks
