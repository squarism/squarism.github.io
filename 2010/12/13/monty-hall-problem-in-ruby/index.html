    <h1>Monty Hall Problem in Ruby</h1>
    <p class="meta">Dec 13, 2010 â€¢ Posted by: chris</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I was reading a thread on stackoverflow about randomness and cryptography security and there was a comment that started me down a series of articles talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">the Monty Hall problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>The take away from the probability puzzle is that you should switch.  It's completely unintuitive and I didn't really get it even after reading about it for some time until I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhlc7peGlGg">this youtube video</a>.  It's a bit slow paced but it's the best explanation and visuals out there.</p>
<p>So even after grok'ing the concept, I wanted to prove it.  So I wrote a ruby program to simulate the game show.  Here's the results from one run:<br />
<code>Monty Hall Games Played: 1000<br />
Player 1 (switches): 675/1000 : 67.50%<br />
Player 2 (stays)   : 325/1000 : 32.50%</code></p>
<p>The code is pretty simple and quick.  Of note is that I sort of use the same game and player_2 just picks the same door of the same game using the same rand(3) number.  So this is like two people playing at the same time and one always switches.  I used the sleep statement near the bottom to keep the terminal from blinking.  Seems to not blink on Mac or Linux but I remember having some weird behavior somewhere.</p>

<p># Create new game show<br />

  g = Game.new<br />
  g.run(player_1, player_2)<br />
  g.stats(player_1, player_2)</p>
<p>  # for terminal sanity if terminal blinks too much<br />
  #sleep 0.02<br />
end<br />
</p>
<p>It was a good exercise.  I was playing around with ruby-ncurses but it became too much of a hassle.  Maybe some other project will need a TUI, I do still want to play with ncurses or something similar.</p>
