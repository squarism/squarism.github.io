  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Recently, I've resigned from my position to pursue a more flexible and collegiate atmosphere at another company.  I'm recklessly optimistic almost always but I feel like this is a good change for me.  Not that there weren't smart people at Oracle, it was just a little crazy at times and I needed free time cycles to move into more bleeding edge areas instead of picking up more and more enterprise software skills.  Ok, enough about that.  The important part is that I negotiated a month off at the new place for studying and ramping up on new technologies.  Very awesome of them.</p>
<p>An interest of mine is NoSQL or alternative databases and scaling massive hashtables.  There's a possibility that I might be working with a dataset so large that it can't be solved with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a> style process.  This is timely because I was just watching <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/videos/introduction_to_hive">a video from Cloudera</a> about Facebook having the same problems with large datasets on Oracle DB and then moving to Hive + Hadoop.  Hopefully, I can hack on this to expand out my DB skills (as a dev) to a non-relational platform.  There's some guides on setting up a cheap cluster on EC2.  Although I have some hardware, I think I'll go that route.  At the very least I'll understand more about how Facebook scaled and how Mapreduce can be implemented.  I hope to find a non-trivial problem to solve (ie: something beyond counting words).</p>
<p>In addition to that very new and complex goal, there's some other things I want to hack on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Rails+3+-+Getting+Started">MongoDB</a>, especially as a horizontal scaling DB</li>
<li>Rails3 upgrade and testing of new gems on my RSS analyzer project</li>
<li>Cleaning up said RSS project to the point that I can share a 0.1 on github or what-not</li>
<li>Continuing to hack on my Tatris port to Obj-C / iOS</li>
<li>Break into node.js some more.  Play with <a href="http://dailyjs.com/2010/09/13/juggernaut/">websockets</a>.</li>
<li>Amazon is giving away EC2 dev instances and I've never played with their weird command line tools and AMI thingies.</li><br />
</ul>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Of course there are distractions to all these very work relevant things.  I have a languishing tetris clone that I haven't touched since the summer and I never got around to adding sound effects to that.  Producing the effects should be a problem but I'm not sure how hard it's going to be to get back into that code.  Thar be ghosts and cobwebs.</p>
<p>Game and graphics aren't very work relevant (I haven't found a simulation job).  Even less so is playing around with my arduino.  There are a few basics I want to get down and then possibly integrate them all into a functional thing.  Something I would actually leave alone and serve some permanent purpose.  I have a few ideas but I don't want to foretell or foreblog.  There's also a RAD project I want to check out (Ruby on Arduino).  I have no idea how it works or if it's what I want to use.  </p>
