    <h1>Biggest object_id value in Ruby</h1>
    <p class="meta">Dec 21, 2010 â€¢ Posted by: chris</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>0 = 1, 1 = 3, 2 = 5, 100 = 201.  What is going on?  Ruby has object_ids on objects but they are shorter on small integers.  Fire up irb and follow along:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
&gt; obj = Object.new<br />
 =&gt; #<object:0x100362a30><br />
&gt; obj.object_id<br />
 =&gt; 2149258520<br />

<p>The value of object_id is the normal looking ids I've seen in the past.  But then I did this:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
 0.object_id<br />
 =&gt; 1<br />
&gt; 1.object_id<br />
 =&gt; 3<br />
&gt; 2.object_id<br />
 =&gt; 5<br />
&gt; 100.object_id<br />
 =&gt; 201<br />
</pre>
<p>Ok, why the values?  Why is 0's id 1 and 100's id 201?  It looks like it's doubling the value and adding one but that seems a little random and probably not what it's actually doing.  So I read a bit by Caleb Tennis on <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/02/ruby_values_and_object_ids.html">Oreilly</a> and found a tip off that it's related to binary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus 0&Atilde;&mdash;0101 (5) becomes 0&Atilde;&mdash;1011 (11).</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that Caleb is noting that "101" is shifting left and adding 1 at the lowest bit.  So then this should work:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
x = 0<br />
puts x.object_id == ( (x &lt;&lt; 1) + 1 )<br />
true<br />
=&gt; nil<br />
</pre>
<p>And it does.  We can set a bigger number and run it again and it still works.</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
x = 65536<br />
puts x.object_id == ( (x &lt;&lt; 1) + 1 )<br />
true<br />
=&gt; nil<br />
</pre>
<p>I will call this predictable behavior later.  x.object_id is 131073 on both sides because we know how object_id is generated:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
x = 65536<br />
 =&gt; 65536<br />
&gt; puts x.object_id<br />
131073<br />
&gt; puts ( (x &lt;&lt; 1) + 1 )<br />
131073<br />
</pre>
<p>So what is going on?  Well first, let's print out the binary.  Taken from <a href="http://icfun.blogspot.com/2008/04/ruby-number-conversion-from-one-base-to.html">icfun.blogspot.com</a>, we'll define a number to binary string method in irb.</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
def dec2bin(number)<br />
   number = Integer(number);<br />
   if(number == 0)<br />
      return 0;<br />
   end<br />
   ret_bin = "";<br />
   ## Untill val is zero, convert it into binary format<br />
   while(number != 0)<br />
      ret_bin = String(number % 2) + ret_bin;<br />
      number = number / 2;<br />
   end<br />
   return ret_bin;<br />
end<br />
</pre>
<p>We can test that it works with any integer.  Let's test with the number 5 like this: <code>puts dec2bin(5)</code>.  Prints out 101.  If we shift left by one bit like this: <code>dec2bin((5 &lt;&lt; 1))</code> then we'll get 1010.  Add 1 bit and we get the binary of eleven: 1011.  We can see if this is eleven with dec2bin(11) and we get "1011" which is what we expected.  It makes sense.</p>
<p>So wtf.  Why know this stuff?  Well, when doing object comparisons, I always expected some garbage or randomness and length similar to a hash.  Like when doing <code>(Object.new).object_id</code> but this isn't dependable or consistent when getting the object_id of a Fixnum.  And even that is not consistent.  The examples above are using small numbers.  When we try this:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
x = 4; puts x.object_id == ( (x &lt;&lt; 1) + 1 )<br />
true<br />
</pre><br />
It works fine.  4 is small.  Let's call this "predictable".  We can bit shift and add 1 to get the same value as ruby does with object_id.
<p>But a big enough number like 5000000000000000000 is false.  So what's the inflection point?  Maybe the inflection point is 2^32 because it's memory related:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
x = 4294967296; puts x.object_id == ( (x &lt;&lt; 1) + 1 )<br />
</pre>
<p>Nope.  Strange.</p>
<p>So I played around manually and started finding that 4 quintillion is true but 5 quintillion is false.  Weird.  If it's memory related, it's no number I recognize.  So we know that there's some inflection point between 4 quintillion and 5 quintillion.  I'm not about to figure this thing out by hand.  Let's write a program to find our magic number.</p>
<p>Note: the current version (if any) is <a href="https://github.com/squarism/sandbox/blob/master/object_id_inflection.rb">on github</a>.</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
# find the inflection point of how ruby calculates object_ids predictably<br />

  sleep 0.1</p>
<p>end<br />
</p>
<p>When we run this little number searcher we find our overflow (or inflection) point.  It will run for a while, finding each digit like this:<br />
<code>4400000000000000000<br />
4700000000000000000<br />
4500000000000000000<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
4611686018427387900<br />
4611686018427387904<br />
4611686018427387902<br />
4611686018427387903<br />
4611686018427387904<br />
4611686018427387903<br />
4611686018427387903</code></p>
<p>Eventually we'll have a final value of 4611686018427387903 which we can test like this:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
4611686018427387903.object_id =&gt; 9223372036854775807<br />
4611686018427387904.object_id =&gt; 2152612560<br />
</pre>
<p>You can see it overflow making 9223372036854775807 the largest object_id in Ruby.</p>
<p>This program is not very efficient or well written.  There's a better way to find a number but I decided to go with a digit-by-digit algorithm.  It was not very easy and quick to write.  I nearly scrapped it and did it the right way but managed to get it working around midnight one night.  I hope it makes for a good (or anti-pattern) example.</p>
