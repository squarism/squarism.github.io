    <h1>Reversing sentences with Ruby.</h1>
    <p class="meta">May 1, 2010 â€¢ Posted by: chris</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p>A question came up today about how to reverse a sentence.  Word by word, preserving periods etc.  I've done stuff like this before but I really saw an opportunity to solve this <em>contrived</em> quiz type question with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>.  It's perfect really.  Tedious string checking?  Screw it.  Let my test tell me when I'm done.</p>
<p>Ok so I could have probably done this more comfortably in Java but it would have been more lines.  I banged this out in Ruby, including "learning" test cases (it's really easy) in about an hour.  At one point I realized how easy string manipulation is in Ruby for this and I literally said, "holy shit Ruby is amazing".  And then the edge cases started happening.  I was only handling periods and my algorithm fell over flat on three sentences because I was trying to do a string[start, end] when it's really string[start, length].  I fixed it with learning the String#slice syntax.</p>
<p>Ok enough fanboi service.  There's two files.  One's the test and one's the class.  Run the test and not the class (ie: ruby tc_reverser.rb).</p>
<p>tc_reverser.rb:</p>
<pre lang="ruby" line="1">require 'test/unit'<br />
require 'reverser'
<p>  # Be wary of newlines in the test and expected trings.<br />
  # Do not try to word wrap with escapes.  It's very picky.<br />
class TestReverser &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase<br />
  # Optional<br />
  #def setup<br />
  #end</p>
<p>  def teardown<br />
    if @test_passed then<br />
      puts "\n #{@r.reverse}"  # more verbose for successful passes<br />
      puts "#{@method_name.upcase} OK.\n\n"<br />
    else<br />
      puts "#{@method_name.upcase} FAIL.\n\n"<br />
    end<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # simple test<br />
  def test_reverser<br />
    test = "You space bastard.  You killed my pine."<br />
    expected = "Bastard space you.  Pine my killed you."<br />
    @r = Reverser.new(test)<br />
    assert_equal(expected, @r.reverse, "Fail.")<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # Test multiple sentence delimiters<br />
  def test_multiple_sentence_delimiters<br />
    test = "Shape up, man.  You're a slacker.  Do you want to be a slacker for the rest of your life?"<br />
    expected = "Man, up shape.  Slacker a you're.  Life your of rest the for slacker a be to want you do?"<br />
    @r = Reverser.new(test)<br />
    assert_equal(expected, @r.reverse, "Fail.")<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # Test no periods, question mark and commas<br />
  def test_question_comma<br />
    test = "Then tell me, future boy, huh, who's president of the United States in 1985?"<br />
    expected = "1985 in States United the of president who's, huh, boy future, me tell then?"<br />
    @r = Reverser.new(test)<br />
    assert_equal(expected, @r.reverse, "Fail.")<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # Big test<br />
  def test_everything<br />
    test = "Our first television set. Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? Well, yeah, you know, we have two of them. Wow! You must be rich. Oh, honey, he's teasing you. Nobody has two television sets."<br />
    expected = "Set television first our.  Today up it picked just dad.  Television a have you do?  Them of two have we, know you, yeah, well.  Wow!  Rich be must you.  You teasing he's, honey, oh.  Sets television two has nobody."<br />
    @r = Reverser.new(test)<br />
    assert_equal(expected, @r.reverse, "Fail.")<br />
  end</p>
<p>end<br />
</p>
<p>I have to apologize for the scrollbars in the above posted code.  I tried many different ways of escaping carriage returns for better formatting but it would have required a lot of changes to deal with the \n and so on in the tests.  I had something nicely formatted working but the tabs and spaces for alignment then screwed the test and broke the pretty formatting a different way.</p>

<p>Marty McFly would be proud.  So some limitations.  First, I don't handle elipsis (...) characters at all.  It splits on sentence delimiters which one is a period.  The eplisis would cause major weirdness.  I also don't handle recapitalizing the word "Dad" as you can see in the "test_everything" test.  This would require language parsing or a massive pick list.  I also don't handle slang or abbreviations.  For example, "You told 'em?"  would turn into "'em told you?" which might not be exactly right.</p>
<p>There are many other edge cases that this thing would fall flat on.  My test case tests what functionality I wanted and nothing more.</p>
<p>Ruby's String#slice was super handy on this as well as capitalize, reverse and even a regex split that I didn't use (amazing!).  You can see it here.  It would split text into an array really easily:</p>
<pre lang="ruby">
sentence_array = @text.split(/[\.\!\?]/)  # split with regular expression
<p>new_sentence_array = Array.new<br />
sentence_array.each do |s|<br />
    new_sentence_array.push(do_reverse(s))<br />
end</p>
<p>puts sentence_array[2]<br />
return<br />
</p>
<p>But then I'd lose the delimiter character (!?. etc) and would have to save it, search it or some other nonsense.  Still, really neat that you can split on a regex.</p>
