  <article class="post-content">
  <p>I had a flaky network problem where high loads (fast downloads from tux.org or sun.com) would cause a hang or complete drop of all network connections on the box.  Originally, I had plugged in two CAT5 cables hoping that it would be one of the gbit ethernet ports but that had no effect.</p>
<p>When the network went down I was unable to ping or do anything network related until someone physically walked to the box and did a <code>service network restart</code>.  It was quite annoying since this box was in a remote location.</p>
<p>The error message that appeared in <code>/var/log/messages</code> was:</p>
<p><code>Mar 17 16:45:14 {servername} kernel: tg3: tg3_stop_block timed out, ofs=3400 enable_bit=2</code></p>
<p>Eventually, I found (with help of a coworker) that the box was reachable when it was 'down' on the local subnet.  I could ssh in from a box on the same subnet and fix the problem.  Not a bad workaround but the crashing was fairly easy to produce.  About 1 or 2 minutes of ~300KB (bytes, not bits) of fast downloading would cause the "Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5700 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 12)" to die.</p>
<p>This was running Fedora Core 1.  I had a similar box (a poweredge 1750) that was running RedHat9 working fine.  I was very confused because the linux kernels were very close in version numbers.</p>
<p>I googled and found many people with the same problem.  In the past I've fixed problems like this by using a generic driver like `tulip' or something.  I eventually tried a different network driver in this vein of thought.  My /etc/modules.conf file had</p>
<p><code>alias eth0 tg3<br />
alias eth1 tg3</code></p>
<p>At the top, so I tried <code>depmod e1000</code> which spit out a bunch of IRQ errors meaning that the driver couldn't find the appropriate hardware.  I tried bcm5700 which linux didn't have compiled in by default.  I wasn't about to do a whole kernel recompile for one stupid driver.  I tried e100 and it returned no errors.  This was happy.</p>
<p><code>lsmod</code> showed that e100 was loaded although showing "0" in the "Used By" column.  That's ok.  So maybe I can use the e100 driver for eth0 or eth1 ... but this still didn't explain why I was able to get to the box (on eth1) on the same subnet.</p>
<p>Then I found the answer which as of now seems to be the answer.  <code>netstat -nr</code> shows this {ips changed to protect the innocent}:</p>
<p><code>[root@server /]# netstat -nr<br />
Kernel IP routing table<br />
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface<br />
10.0.0.96   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.224 U         0 0          0 eth1<br />
10.0.0.96   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.224 U         0 0          0 eth1<br />
169.254.0.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth1<br />
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U         0 0          0 lo<br />
0.0.0.0         10.0.0.97   0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0</code></p>
<p>Note that 0.0.0.0 (the default route) is specifically going through eth0.  Now it makes sense.  So I changed <code>alias eth0 tg3</code> -&gt; <code>alias eth0 e100</code>, ran <code>depmod -a</code>, rebooted a few times and heavy downloads have been running smoothly for 27 minutes now.</p>
<p>I'll update this if this solution turns evil.  :}  For now, the e100 is metal.  \m/</p>
