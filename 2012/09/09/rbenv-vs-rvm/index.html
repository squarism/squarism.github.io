    <h1>Rbenv vs RVM</h1>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p><img src="http://squarism.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/bundler_px.png" alt="" title="bundler_px" width="243" height="164" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1636" /><br />
I used to use RVM with gemsets and loved it.  Wayne's work is amazing and way beyond any shell-fu I know.  I was super impressed as I started and used it for at least a year on my main dev box.</p>
<p>Then I upgraded ruby a few times and that was ok.  But then I sudo'd to root and got:<br />
<code># ~/.rvm does not exist (or something)</code></p>
<p>Here are some things I didn't like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gemsets are great except when you are managing different global gemsets on different boxes.</li>
<li>Maybe you work on a project that maybe doesn't use RVM and you wonder if they really want an .rvm-gemset file in their project root.</li>
<li>I loved upgrading my default ruby using RVM until it failed and I had to recreate all gemsets and reinstall all gems.</li>
<li>Gemset exporting I never really got.</li><br />
</ul>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h2>Rbenv is better?</h2>
<p><br />
So I’ve switched to no gemsets and rbenv.  I just use rbenv and ruby-build.  Rbenv seems to runs a lot lighter and doesn’t complain on sudo.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<h2>RVM is better?</h2>
<p><br />
RVM beats rbenv in gemsets though.  Rbenv gemsets don’t have global so you have to create a pre-install rails just to <code>rails new</code>.  It’s a chicken before the egg thing.  There’s no global gemset so rails doesn’t exist and you don’t have a directory to create the .rbenv-gemsets file in.  So you have to create a tmp rails project with like the Rails 3.0 generator.  And then you have to upgrade that project or something.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p><strong>update:</strong>This might not be true.  If you delete your .rbenv-gemsets file out of your home directory and make sure that each project has it's own gems installed then `gem` will be global and you can install/remove gems as normal.  So your global gemset is when `rbenv gemset active` returns nothing.</p>
<p>Upgrading ruby versions with rbenv does not import your gems.  So you have to wait until you need them and install them with `bundle` or pre-cd into each of your projects to install them?</p>
<p>So that's why I went with a third option.</p>
<h2>No Gemsets at all!</h2>
<p><br />
Bundler works but with no gemsets, you end up with a lot of dupe versions that don’t hurt anything.  You can bundle exec foo and the correct version of foo will be loaded.  However, I do miss having clean gemsets.  This list grows and grows without end.<br />
<code><br />
&gt; gem search rails<br />
*** LOCAL GEMS ***<br />
rails (3.2.8, 3.2.2, 3.0.16)<br />
</code>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Having dupe versions is kind of annoying after a while, especially if you wanted to create a mobile rails dev env on a usb key.  You don't know what your dependencies are.  Or do you?  You can go until a project with Bundler and do:<br />
<code><br />
&gt; bundle list<br />
Gems included by the bundle:<br />
  * abstract (1.0.0)<br />
  * actionmailer (3.0.16)<br />
  * actionpack (3.0.16)<br />
  * activemodel (3.0.16)<br />
  ...<br />
</code></p>
<p>Then I guess I could copy all the gems somewhere.  But it's not automatic.  With gemsets, each project was in a directory and I could just grab all the *.gem files.</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p><br />
So there’s pros and cons to each method.  I have no problems without gemsets but I don’t have cleanliness.  I just don’t know what the downside to having a messy system is.  Honestly, a patch to <code>gem</code> where gem list would just colorize the list from bundle list would be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
