  content: ! "Howdy just wanted to give you a quick heads up.\r\nThe words in your
    article seem to be running off the screen in Ie.\r\nI'm not sure if this is a
    format issue or something to do with internet browser compatibility but I thought
    I'd post to let you know.\r\nThe design look great though! Hope you get the issue
    fixed soon.\r\nThanks"

A common metaphor for a computer is that it's a giant calculator.  It's easy to imagine a larger and larger machine.  Pictures of a small desk calculator evolving into a slightly larger version, morphing into something the size of a breadbox with more buttons, changing into something the size of a refrigerator and finally we nod our heads and say "it's a calculator but bigger".  That's why it's so powerful!  It's a huge calculator!  But it's not.

It's a state machine.

What huge numbers would a calculator be unable to calculate anyway?  You know that scientific notation
`1.274921411340194917490141234 Ã— 10^27`?  I've seen that in a calculator.  Doesn't that let the calculator handle a number of extremely large size?  Is that why it can't play games?  Does a calculator not calculate enough?  Or, is a state machine that is too slow to render real-time graphics.

It's not that a calculator can't store big numbers.  It's that a computer is so quick on changing its internal state that it can trick us with simulations and graphics.

A CPU is not a brain either but that's a different post.

I encourage you to checkout [the State Machine gem](https://github.com/pluginaweek/state_machine) to play around with this concept.  It has direct relevance to game development and other areas.
