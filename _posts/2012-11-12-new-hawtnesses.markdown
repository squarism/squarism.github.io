<p>Wow, how can anyone keep up?</p>

<h3>Zeus</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://vimeo.com/46795747">Video of Zeus in action</a>.  Is it the new spork?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/uploads/2012/11/zeus-580x307.png" alt="" title="zeus" width="580" height="307" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1778" />
</p>

Super fast Rails boot times, but not just booting.  Everything!  Like DRB on steroids.</p>
<h3>FishFish shell</h3>
<p>
`brew install fishfish`.  The new ZSH?  A fork of the Fish shell.  Featured in the above video link.  Be sure to uninstall fish through homebrew if you have already.  It's not the same thing.</p>

<h3>YADR</h3>
<p>
<img src="/uploads/2012/11/yadr-580x444.png" alt="" title="yadr" width="580" height="444" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1777" />
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://skwp.github.com/dotfiles/">YADR</a> - for me, the new codegram/vimfiles?  Impressive documentation, will really change my muscle memory.</p>

<h3>Prezto</h3>
<p>
Included with YADR, looks to be a replacement for oh-my-zsh (my fav).  Will have to try it out and update this.</p>
