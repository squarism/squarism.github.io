Wow, how can anyone keep up?

### Zeus

[Video of Zeus in action](https://vimeo.com/46795747).  Is it the new spork?

Super fast Rails boot times, but not just booting.  Everything!  Like DRB on steroids.</p>

### FishFish shell

`brew install fishfish`.  The new ZSH?  A fork of the Fish shell.  Featured in the above video link.  Be sure to uninstall fish through homebrew if you have already.  It's not the same thing.

### YADR

[YADR](http://skwp.github.com/dotfiles/) - for me, the new codegram/vimfiles?  Impressive documentation, will really change my muscle memory.

### Prezto

Included with YADR, looks to be a replacement for oh-my-zsh (my fav).  Will have to try it out and update this.
