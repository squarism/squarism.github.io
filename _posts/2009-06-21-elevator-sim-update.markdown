Quick update about <a href="http://squarism.com/2009/04/26/elevator-sim-wip/">the elevator sim post</a>.  Currently the cars are animating fine.  IE: you press 3 and car #1 goes to floor three, stops, opens the door and waits.  If you press 1, the car closes the door, moves to floor 1 and opens the door.  The building controller is aware of the care state as evidenced by the little labels you see.</p>
<p>The person sprite (on that line there) is currently a placeholder.  He paths over to wait for the elevator but I don't have the "AI" done for him to wait.</p>
<p>This has lost a bit of traction since I've been cranking on the iPhone class.</p>
