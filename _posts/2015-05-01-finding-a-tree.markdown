title: Finding a Tree
---
When I moved to Portland, I saw this tree on I-5 outside the city.  It
kind of stands by itself.  *Pokes out* before you hit downtown.  I always
wondered where it was.  Was it huge?  Was it normal?  How would I find
it?

Since I'm trying to explore the city and I had a week off between jobs
(oh yeah, that news), I thought I'd take a break from the tech blogging
and tell you about this tree I finally found after all these months.

First, I can't believe my luck on this new Google Maps feature.  I had
used the Google Earth desktop app before but I didn't realize it's the
_satellite_ view now.  It's pretty intense on the graphics card.  My mac
was overheating while my gaming PC was yawning.  So it's not _laptop_ or
_old mac_ friendly.  :)

So here's a picture of the tree as you'd see it from I-5.

Here's the dead give-away shot from Google Earth.  After that, it was
easy to track down.  All I had to do is zoom and pan to the tree poking
out in the orange circle here:

I went to the street it's on and took a few photos.  It looks just like
it does from the highway.  And it's lined up with the city.

It actually turned out to be a bunch of trees all clumped together.

Awesome.  What a fun use of the google earth view in google maps.
