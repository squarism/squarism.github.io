![](/uploads/2010/12/bluetooth_connected.png "bluetooth_connected")So you've replaced the batteries, restarted your mouse or whatever.  You have a bluetooth mouse that you need to reconnect or re-pair but you don't have a mouse to get to the bluetooth icon in the notification area or status bar location.

Here what you do:

1.  _Command Key + Shift + /_ - gets you into the help area in any menu
2.  _Right arrow_ - gets you to the Apple menu
3.  _Down arrow until System Preferences_
4.  _Enter_ - opens System Preferences
5.  _Type mouse_ - in the search box and hit enter will open the mouse pane
6.  _Hit enter at the "no mouse found" screen_ - this will pair your mouse if it's powered on and trying to pair</p>

Problem solved.  Leave a comment if it works or a similar problem but different solution worked for you.  If you can't click in the comment box, just scream really loud towards my email address.  :)
