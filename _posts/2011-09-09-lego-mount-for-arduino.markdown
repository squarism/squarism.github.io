excerpt: ! "I got to thinking (that's another story) about the old Technics set that
  I had when I was a kid and how useful it would be if I could tear down and build
  things without having to hacksaw stuff (i.e. like with the <a href=\"http://www.microrax.com/\">Microrax</a>
  stuff).  We had major flooding recently (after an earthquake and a hurricane) and
  the closed roads funneled me to a toy store.  Was this a sign?  I'm not sure.  All
  I know is I have a Mindstorms kit now.  :)\r\n\r\nSo I built an Arduino frame using
  nothing but the parts from the Mindstorms kit (it's all just Technics parts).  It's
  pretty sturdy and the little rubber ends hold the board down pretty good.  I figure
  it's good enough to put on wheels or a quad-ped bot.  I don't know if I'd send it
  up in the air.  I'd probably want to add a few more cross bars in there.  Anyway,
  I did a lot of refactoring (if you could call it that) and I think this design is
  pretty good.  Here's the money shot with the rest of the build shots so you can
  copy it.  I'm fresh brand-new to the Lego scene so leave some comments if I did
  something stupid.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/2011/09/lego_arduino_1-580x433.png\"

I got to thinking (that's another story) about the old Technics set that I had when I was a kid and how useful it would be if I could tear down and build things without having to hacksaw stuff (i.e. like with the [Microrax](http://www.microrax.com/) stuff).
