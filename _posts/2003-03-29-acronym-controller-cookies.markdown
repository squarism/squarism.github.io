    Yeah, cookies aren''t that hard to get around.  But IP logging is too messy and
    it''s not reliable.  I''m taking the easy way out, this isn''t a Top Secret project.  You
    should put some forums up or something.  I want to contrib to TBO, but no joy.  :)

Update on new functionality.

Received my [XP programming book](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jextprockbk/) in the mail.  It is fabulous.  I spent all day reading it.  Wonderfully written.  Great advice.  Real world examples and overviews.

With XP advice in belt, I cleaned up many things in the Voting actions and I have cookies working to prevent people from voting twice on an acronym response.  I'll post an updated version soon.
