<p>Found <a href="http://www.abundanttech.com/webservices/population/population.asmx/getWorldPopulation">this </a>and I'm sure it's old news to anyone who's used soap.</p>
<p>It's from <a href="http://www.xmethods.net/">the xmethods website</a> which has a list of web services, some work, others don't.</p>
