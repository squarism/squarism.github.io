No joke.  Here's a snippet out of an E15k manual.

`
Internal SRAM protection inside the UltraSPARC III Cu CPU. With higherdensity CPUs and lower-core voltages, SRAM cells have become more vulnerable to bit flips from cosmic-ray disturbances. Single-bit errors for the majority of the internal SRAMs are detected and are recoverable.
`

I'm sure [it happens](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=cosmic%20rays).  I just find it funny that Sun has to design its chips to withstand interstellar high energy particles (or what-not).  I'm no physicist.
