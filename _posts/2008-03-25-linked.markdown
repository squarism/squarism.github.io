<p>I just finished a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linked-Everything-Connected-Else-Means/dp/0452284392/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&sr=8-1">Linked</a>.  It's a book about network theory and covers a wide variety of topics very quickly.  It's not incredibly long but I found it very interesting just because of speculation I've done over the years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I've wondered if the patterns I see in some subject translate (either by divine will or mathematics) into other subjects.  For example, if the 80/20 rule applies in software, does it apply to business or biology or anything else?  The author covers these kinds of things in a much more journalistic approach than my everyday speculation and casual daydreaming could.  It was reinforcing in a way.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, the author has a diagram of a three-point triangle.  He relates the node map to society and members of society as connectors and hubs.  The chapter covered topics like infection and how certain hub-people will transmit disease faster than others.  It's a bit more complicated than how I'm summarizing but the diagram caught my attention none-the-less.  The author started with a node and then added nodes recursively (whether he knew it or not).  So I fired up the <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a> program and tried to draw what he had made but make it configurable with depth.  Here's the result, was fun.</p>
<p>The depth goes 1,2,4,8.  After that it becomes a white mess.</p>
