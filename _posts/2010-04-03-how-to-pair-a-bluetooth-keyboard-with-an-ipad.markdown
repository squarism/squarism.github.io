    to "unpair" with my MacBook so that the iPad would discover it.

  content: Yes.  This is true with all bluetooth devices.  They can't be shared.

  content: Thanks Dillon... I was thinking till you told me that this was Apple specific.
    If it's the way with all bluetooth then I can deal with it much better.

  content: I am using iSSH to do VNC. It's not free, and using it can be frustrating
    at times, because I'm not ever sure whether it will register a touch as a click
    or a screen-drag, but it's nice to know my home workstation is available to me.

  content: Thanks for the advice on pairing the Bluetooth Keyboard. Being new to Apple,
    it is taking me a lot of time to learn the in's and out's. I spent hours trying

    step by step, and BINGO, it works like a charm ! Thanks!!

I figured out something that was a bit unintuitive.  I have an Apple Wireless Bluetooth keyboard paired with a Mac.  I wanted to see if it works on my iPad.  I went to Bluetooth->Disconnect on the Mac and the keyboard showed up in the iPad Bluetooth discovery screen but it wouldn't pair.</p>
<p>I just happened to find a method to get this working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select disconnect on the Mac.</li>
<li>Turn off bluetooth completely on the Mac.</li>
<li>Hold down the power button on the keyboard to turn it off.</li>
<li>Press the power button once on the keyboard to turn it on.</li>
<li>The keyboard will show up in the iPad bluetooth list as before but now when you click it, the keyboard light will start flashing as it pairs.</li>
<li>The iPad will tell you to type a code and enter.</li>
<li>Good to go!</li>
</ul></p>
<p><a href="http://squarism.com/2010/04/03/how-to-pair-a-bluetooth-keyboard-with-an-ipad/bluetooth_ipad/" rel="attachment wp-att-406"><img src="/uploads/2010/04/Bluetooth_iPad.png" alt="" title="Bluetooth_iPad" width="1024" height="261" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-406" /></a></p>
<p>It works for text areas in the browser and email windows.  The on-screen keyboard doesn't appear.  It's way faster to enter a blog post like this (hehe).  It doesn't seem to work for navigating menus (with the arrow keys or anything).  Think of it as a replacement for the on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>Also, be aware that you do have to unpair with the computer.  Pairing means 1-to-1.  Not 1-to-many.  This is how bluetooth (even on PC) works unfortunately.  If you want to broadcast keyboard strokes out to many computers you'll have to use something like VNC.  Unfortunately there isn't a VNC server that I know of for the iPad yet (if ever).  The iPhone versions of VNC require you to jailbreak your phone which can be a pain if you like "quick and easy".  I rarely use my bluetooth keyboard on my media center so I didn't buy a second one.  Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone!  Post a comment if it did.</p>
