excerpt: ! 'I started this install log because I thought upgrading to 9.0 would be
  a serious pain in the neck.  It turns out it went <b>very smoothly</b> and there''s
  not much to say here.

  <p>

  Here''s a quick list of steps that took me through the update.  The update to Gnome
  2.2 is worth it.  Better theme functionality and everything just *seems* to run
  a bit faster with the 2.4.20 kernel running.  No proof, just text consoles react
  *super fast*.
