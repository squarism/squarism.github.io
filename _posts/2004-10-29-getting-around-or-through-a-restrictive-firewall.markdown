If you have a SSH account someplace outside of your locked down network, try [safe passage](http://www.vastrange.com/).

If you want to try to tunnel everything through port 80, check out [gnu httptunnel](http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html) but your program will have to support something like a proxy.
