Was thinking about writing a Perl script to check dictionary domain names still available when I found that [waxy.org](http://waxy.org) had already thought of it.

So I found [hexameter.com](http://hexameter.com) was still available so I spent the $7 to get it and been playing around with a really, really simple artsy type layout just to blow off some minimalism steam.
