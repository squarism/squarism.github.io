<p>Was thinking about writing a Perl script to check dictionary domain names still available when I found that <a href="http://waxy.org">waxy.org</a> had already thought of it.</p>
<p>So I found <a href="http://hexameter.com">hexameter.com</a> was still available so I spent the $7 to get it and been playing around with a really, really simple artsy type layout just to blow off some minimalism steam.</p>
