Updated this a bit.  Added sound, scanlines, mouse following, bird sprite thing.  Made a few performance tweaks.  It still runs a bit slow, it's better under OpenGL but you can't embed it in a web page.  The code is from a while back and I just polished it a bit so the source is fugly, fugly, fugly.  I like the tune though.  The ableton live demo has turned into a musical idea notebook and a short idea is all I seem to grind on.

The music is original (no samples).
