<p>I wanted lua installed on my Mac for some gamedev tests ... darwinports didn't give me a warm fuzzy.  In uninstalled DarwinPorts with:
<code>sudo rm -rf /opt/local /Applications/DarwinPorts /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup</code></p>
<p>And then downloaded fink (the universal binary).  After installing the rather large 17mb package, fink wasn't working.  First the path /sw/bin wasn't added to my profile.  I fixed that by editing ~/.bash_profile:
<code>PATH=$PATH:/sw/bin</code>
Simple enough but then you're supposed to type "fink scanpackages; fink index" after the install is done.  That failed like this:</p>
<p><code>$ fink index
...
Failed: Can't locate auto/Term/ReadKey/termsizeopt.al in @INC</code></p>
<p>So then I googled this and only found <a href="http://radastery.jp/blog/2006/10/intel_mac_fink.html">a jp site</a> that suggested this:
<code>
$ sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Term::ReadKey
</code></p>
<p>Which fixed the `fink index` command.</p>
