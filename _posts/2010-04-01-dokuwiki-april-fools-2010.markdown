[![](/uploads/2010/04/dokuwiki_april_fools_2010.png "dokuwiki_april_fools_2010")](http://squarism.com/2010/04/01/dokuwiki-april-fools-2010/dokuwiki_april_fools_2010/)

I was checking out some syntax on [dokuwiki's website](http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) and suddenly a duck appeared from the right hand side.  When I hovered over it, I got a web browser crosshair.  When I clicked on it (*bang*), a bullet hole image appeared in the web page and the duck (*quack*) fell to the bottom of the browser window.

Duck hunt!

I didn't see it blogged about yet so there ya go.  Techcrunch has [a good wrap-up](http://techcrunch.com/april-fools-shenanigans/) of 2010 april fool's jokes.  This year didn't seem as big as last year's.
