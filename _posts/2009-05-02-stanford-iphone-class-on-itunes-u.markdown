Going through the CS193P <a href="http://itunes.stanford.edu/">Stanford iTunes U class</a> as if I'm taking it.  It was done in April but I'm going to use the assignment due dates as deadlines for May.  If it's due on April 9, then it's due on May 9 for me.  So far the content is good.  The introductory stuff I got from the book&fail method but it's nice hearing someone explain it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/downloads/Assignment1B.pdf">Assignment 1B</a> is a good API doc researching exercise.</p>
