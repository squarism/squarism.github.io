__outdated__ : _Some of these resources have shut down.  I suggest signing up for the rubyrogues parlay mailing list for up-to-date discussion_.

[destroyallsoftware.com](http://destroyallsoftware.com)
$9 for his entire back catalog.  You can subscribe monthly or just sign up, download all of them and then cancel.

[tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org)
15 minute ruby intro.  Recently bought by the code school guys.

[codeschool.com](http://codeschool.com)
Has a free 2 hour rails tutorial called rails for zombies.  This is really fun but longer.  It's totally interactive.  Very well done.  They have non-free classes too.  Focuses on rails 3 and some advanced stuff.

[railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com)
Not very hand-hold-y.  I regularly watch this site just to learn new things and watch someone work.  These are short in length and very focused.

[rubykoans.com](http://rubykoans.com)
Ruby Koans are practice exercises/meditations on different aspects of Ruby.  There are many similar projects (Python Koans etc).  It's like an interactive cookbook.  Very valuable to do even if you're comfortable with Ruby.  It's a project that has failures built into it and it's your job to fix them.  I did a blog post on it.  I'm not explaining this very well.  It's a bunch of tests set up to fail and you fix the first test case and it continues on.  For example, you might set true = true and then the test suite will have 1 test passing and give you a progress bar.  Very cool and easy to pick up and put down.  Good for reference afterwards.

[confreaks.net](http://confreaks.net)
Lots of conference videos organized by events.  The HTML5 player sucks.  Use the flash one, even that one is a bit picky with pausing and other stuff.

[quickie_mart 20 min app](http://github.com/squarism/quickie_mart/blob/master/README.md)
A plug!  This is a talk that I did.  The README is very short but has all the steps to build a store rails app.  The repo is the completed app.
