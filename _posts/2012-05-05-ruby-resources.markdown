15 minute ruby intro.  Recently bought by the code school guys.</p>

Has a free 2 hour rails tutorial called rails for zombies.  This is really fun but longer.  It's totally interactive.  Very well done.  They have non-free classes too.  Focuses on rails 3 and some advanced stuff.</p>

Not very hand-hold-y.  I regularly watch this site just to learn new things and watch someone work.  These are short in length and very focused.</p>

Ruby Koans are practice exercises/meditations on different aspects of Ruby.  There are many similar projects (Python Koans etc).  It's like an interactive cookbook.  Very valuable to do even if you're comfortable with Ruby.  It's a project that has failures built into it and it's your job to fix them.  I did a blog post on it.  I'm not explaining this very well.  It's a bunch of tests set up to fail and you fix the first test case and it continues on.  For example, you might set true = true and then the test suite will have 1 test passing and give you a progress bar.  Very cool and easy to pick up and put down.  Good for reference afterwards.</p>

Lots of conference videos organized by events.  The HTML5 player sucks.  Use the flash one, even that one is a bit picky with pausing and other stuff.</p>

A plug!  This is a talk that I did.  The README is very short but has all the steps to build a store rails app.  The repo is the completed app.</p>
