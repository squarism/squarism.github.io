Tried filling out hours and hours of captchas while watching the newborn.  It didn't go so well.  I got sore hands and didn't get $100 of free stuff.  I ended up ordering a new arduino r3 anyway and a stepper motor to hopefully build a quiet baby rocker.  I built a few previous iterations of a baby rocker out of Lego technic pieces but the motor was a little bit too loud and I've scrapped the project.

Anyway, here's a screenshot to remind me of the captcha fun.
