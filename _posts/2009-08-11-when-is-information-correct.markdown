<p>A wiki is constantly edited.  Unlike a document which can have revisions and snapshots in time, a wiki may or may not ever be correct.  But hold on.  What is so magical about a revision stamped out?  A book isn't naturally correct.  Information has nothing to do with correctness.</p>
<p>Think about a filesystem check (like <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Lets+be+More+Rational+on+CHKDSK+in+Windows+7/article15910.htm">Windows7 CHKDSK</a>, ha).  While fixing and committing filesystem fixes (with or without transactions I don't know), the state of the data is in flux.  When the program finishes, it declares the information to be correct.  Is this declaration any different than someone looking at 1+1=2 and saying "yep."?</p>
<p>Information is correct when an observer correctly or incorrectly says it's correct.  Any deeper discussion of what is correct or real is getting into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum">Descartes</a> territory and I'm not talking about that.  Print off a wikipedia page (version), you (observer) review it (validation) and say it's correct.  The data hasn't changed.  Rather it's a data decoration, metadata about the print-out.</p>
