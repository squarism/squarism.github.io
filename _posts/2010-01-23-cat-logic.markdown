Charles Petzold's book [Code](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) is an awesome read.  I'm reading it again actually.  It's so elegant and simple.  Walks you through history and experiments in a style I find _extremely_ invoking.  I wanted to build a logic switch but I don't want to blow anything up so I tried [this java applet](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) at falstad.com and it works pretty well.  I tried qucs but it's way too complicate for me and doesn't include an LED.

An example from Code (this is not the exact example) is where he's trying to buy a pet from a pet store and he creates a logic circuit that will light up a light bulb when the pet is correct.  Let's say I'm looking for a normal gray cat as a house pet (not a tiger! rawr!).  When I flip all the switches correctly, the LED lights up but if I get a gray tiger (that's technically a cat) then the LED (the red dot) says nope.

The salesman brings me a gray tiger.  Nope.
