I think any topic can be turned into one about security.

## Security is Infinite in Time

You can't buy, have or achieve security.  Any security you think you have [is coupled to time](http://squarism.com/2019/06/04/sprinkle-time-on-that-thing/).  Your feeling or belief of being secure can change to insecure at any momenet.  So security is more like fitness.  You *practice* fitness.  You might be fit now but you cannot be done with fitness.

<div style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 2em; align='center'">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the thing they don‚Äôt tell you about exercise is that you just have to keep doing more of it? all the time?? or it stops working??? it‚Äôs a scam</p>&mdash; shrimp, voted ‚ú®üó≥ü¶ê‚ú® (@geoffwithasword) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffwithasword/status/1384219351490777091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

You have to keep exercising your whole life and this [isn't a completely depressing thought](https://twitter.com/geoffwithasword/status/1384219351490777091?s=20), it's the glass half empty version.  You get to exercise to keep yourself from feeling like crap your whole life. _yea i know that tweet is a joke_

So security is infinite in time so it has the chance to always be a topic, forever.


## Security is Infinite in Scope

I'm going to blindly pull three topics from [lobsters](https://lobste.rs) and spin them into security.

1. [deskto.ps ‚Äî share annotated screenshots of your desktop](https://lobste.rs/s/bbvvhg/deskto_ps_share_annotated_screenshots) - That's easy.  What if you share a screenshot of a password?  Also, someone mentions anonymous sharing (security as authn) in the comments.
1. [std::optional and non-POD C++ types c++ blog.felipe.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/6ql5fs/std_optional_non_pod_c_types) - C++ can have memory leaks, [why not RIIR](https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR).
1. [macOS Finder RCE mac security ssd-disclosure.com](https://lobste.rs/s/drn3xl/macos_finder_rce) - Is already about security, that's no fun.  :(

It's not a weird flex.  I think anyone can spin any topic into a security-based one.  So we need to be diligent, have transparency, find out the details and not just accept all security arguments.

Security is infinite in scope so you can turn any topic into one about security.  Combine these two together and you have my point.
