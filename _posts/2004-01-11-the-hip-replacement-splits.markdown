<p>Last show with my band last night.  Was a really great time.  Lots of people showed.  At least 50, maybe more.  Which was impressive considering the cold.</p>
<p>The best part was at the end.  We blew the power in the place.  Very suiting for our last show.  The whole strip mall was blacked out and the owners asked everyone to settle up their tab and get out.  10 minutes later, the lights went out, we were done with our last show and the parking lot had no lights even to light the way for the poor power technicians who were already on the call.</p>
<p>Don't know if the power outage was our fault, but I'd like to think so.  Go out with a bang.</p>
<p>Our whiteboard was appropriately dressed:
