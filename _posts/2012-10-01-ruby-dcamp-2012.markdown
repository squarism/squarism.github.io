Great conference!  There's a lot to be said about it.  I am not going to post it all, it would take a long of writing.  You can find things about #coderetreat [meetups out there](http://coderetreat.org/profiles/blogs/coderetreat-london-29-09-12).

After decompressing and reflecting, I came to a philosophical realization.

- Rubyists were not taught Ruby in school or elsewhere, they willed their skill into existence.
- Internet access came through the air over cell and we suddenly had dev environments in the middle of the woods.
- The wikipedia description of game of life was just some english bullet points that were implemented 100 times.

So in these three ways, we willed things out of the ether and that is awesome.  For a less philosophical run-down of what happened, check out [Brandon Hays's blog](http://brandonhays.com/blog/2012/10/04/ruby-dcamp-what-i-learned-on-summer-vacation/).
