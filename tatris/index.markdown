<p>I wrote a tetris clone using Processing.org.  I used no game framework and simply graphic and tweening libraries.  I did it in about 6 weeks during a vacation between contracts.  It was the hardest thing I had ever done at the time.  I wrote <a href="http://squarism.com/2009/06/22/making-tatris/">a lengthy post</a> about how I constructed it.</p>

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/squarism/tatris) but it is not reference code by any stretch.
